        <i>            
                You get a shiver in the dark
                It's raining in the park, but meantime
                South of the river
                You stop and you hold everything
                A band is blowing Dixie
                Double four time
                You feel alright
                When you hear the music ring

                [Verse 2]
                Well, now you step inside
                But you don't see too many faces
                Coming in out of the rain to hear the Jazz go down
                Competition in other places
                Ah, but the horns, they blowin' that sound
                Way on down south
                Way on down south, London town

                [Verse 3]
                Check out guitar George
                He knows all the chords
                Mind, it's strictly rhythm
                He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
                Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
                When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
                [Verse 4]
                And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
                He's got a daytime job – he's doing alright
                He can play the Honky Tonk like anything
                Saving it up for Friday night
                With the Sultans
                With the Sultans of Swing

                [Verse 5]
                And a crowd of young boys
                They're fooling around in the corner
                Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
                And their platform soles
                They don't give a damn
                About any trumpet playing band
                It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
                And the Sultans
                Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
                Creole

                [Guitar Solo - 3:20-4:13]

                [Verse 6]
                And then the man
                He steps right up to the microphone
                And says at last
                Just as the time bell rings
                "Goodnight, now it's time to go home"
                Then he makes it fast
                With one more thing
                "We are the Sultans –
                We are the Sultans of Swing"

                I saw her today at the reception
                A glass of wine in her hand
                I knew she would meet her connection
                At her feet was a foot-loose man
                No, you can't always get what you want
                You can't always get what you want
                You can't always get what you want
                But if you try sometime
                You'll find

                Oh
                [Verse 2]
                And I went down to the demonstration
                To get my fair share of abuse
                Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration
                If we don't, we're going to blow a 50-amp fuse"
                Sing it to me, honey

                Ahh
                
                [Verse 3]
                I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
                To get your prescription filled
                I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
                And, man, did he look pretty ill
                We decided that we would have a soda
                My favorite flavor, cherry red
                I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
                Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead"
                I said to him:
                [Chorus]
                You can't always get what you want, well no
                You can't always get what you want, I tell you, baby

                Woo!

                Ah yeah
                
                [Verse 4]
                I saw her today at the reception
                In her glass was a bleeding man
                She was practiced at the art of deception
                Well, I could tell by her blood-stained hands
                Sing it
                
                [Outro]
                You can't always get what you want, yeah
                You can't always get what you want, ooh yeah, child
                You can't always get what you want
                But if you try sometime, you just might find

                You can't always get what you want

                Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
                
                [Verse 1]
                His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
                There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
                He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
                To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
                What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
                He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
                He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now

                Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
                Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
                
                [Chorus]
                You better lose yourself in the music
                The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
                You better lose yourself in the music
                The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)

                This world is mine for the taking, make me king
                As we move toward a New World Order
                A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
                Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
                Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
                These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
                He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
                God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
                He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
                But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
                These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
                They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
                He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
                Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
                But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah
                
                [Chorus]
                You better lose yourself in the music
                The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
                You better lose yourself in the music
                The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
                You better…
                [Verse 3]
                No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
                Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
                I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
                I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
                But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
                Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
                All the pain inside amplified by the
                Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
                Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
                'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
                And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
                And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
                Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
                Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
                Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
                Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
                Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
                To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
                Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
                Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
                To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
                So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
                This may be the only opportunity that I got
                
                [Chorus]
                You better lose yourself in the music
                The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
                You better lose yourself in the music
                The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
                You better…
                [Outro]
                You can do anything you set your mind to, man
